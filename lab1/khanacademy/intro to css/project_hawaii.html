        <p>  Hawaii is a state in the Western United States, located in the Pacific Ocean about
            <br> 2,000 miles (3,200 km) from the U.S. mainland. It is the only U.S. state outside
            <br> North America, the only state that is an archipelago, and the only state in the tropics.
            <br><br><em>Hawaii </em>comprises nearly the entire Hawaiian archipelago, 137 volcanic islands spanning
            <br>1,500 miles (2,400 km) that are physiographically and ethnologically part of the Polynesian
            <br>subregion of Oceania.[9] The state's ocean coastline is consequently the fourth-longest in the U.S.,
            <br>at about 750 miles (1,210 km).[d] The eight main islands, from northwest to southeast, are Niʻihau,
            <br>Kauaʻi, Oʻahu, Molokaʻi, Lānaʻi, Kahoʻolawe, Maui, and Hawaiʻi—the last of these, after which the 
            <br>is named, is often called the "Big Island" or "Hawaii Island" to avoid confusion with the state or
            <br> archipelago.The uninhabited Northwestern Hawaiian Islands make up most of the Papahānaumokuākea Marine 
            <br>National Monument,the United States' largest protected area and the fourth-largest in the world.</p>
        
        <h2 class="place-list-item"> Oahu</h2>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/15/Turtle_Bay%2C_Hawai%27i_-_panoramio.jpg"  width="300">
        <p class ="place-item-back"> Home to Hawaii’s capital and largest city, <em>Oahu </em> is a pretty unique place, to put
            <br> it mildly. Where else on earth can you explore dense rainforest and volcanic craters,
            <br> surf monstrous waves, take-in a multimillion-dollar cityscape, and goof around on a Disney resort?
            <br><br>Honolulu itself has plenty to satisfy history and culture buffs, including the Iolani Palace
            <br>and Honolulu Museum of Art. A great way to see the city and historic Pearl Harbour is to take this
            <br> fascinating four-hour tour in the company of an expert Hawaiian Islands tourist guide. Alternatively,
            <br> if you fancy mixing culture with nature, this full-day trip around the entire island is the perfect
            <br> way to do exactly that. Covering Waimea Valley’s waterfalls, the beautiful Byodo-In temple,
            <br> Halona Blowhole, and much more besides, it gives a great overview of Oahu.</p>
        <h2 class="place-list-item"> Maui</h2>
        <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQpxlFDLcbp3TeGisfAvul6ByuaxXb5hepsySGa-Bgg1oLlLui8cA1y-peuFeGsrDz3zGI&usqp=CAU" width="300">
        <p class="place-item-back"> Glamourous, scenic and with world-class water-sports and whale-watching experiences,
            <br><em>Maui </em> ticks a whole lot of boxes. It’s home to some of the Hawaiian islands’ swankiest
            <br>resorts and best beaches, and big on natural diversity too.
            <br><br> The island’s main tourist area is lively (yet laidback) Lahaina, a waterfront town
            <br> that was once a magnet for whalers and seamen, with the narrow streets once walked by
            <br>Mark Twain and Herman Melville now lined with cafés and restaurants. A street segway tour
            <br> is a fun and family-friendly way to see the town, which is also one of several bases from
            <br> which to join a humpback whale-watching excursion. </p>
        <h2 class="place-list-item"> Kawaii</h2>
        <img src="https://wpcdn.us-east-1.vip.tn-cloud.net/www.hawaiimagazine.com/content/uploads/2021/11/y/i/kauaiitinerary-gettyimages-586170176.jpg" width="300">
        <p class="place-item-back"> It’s not for nothing that <em>Kauai </em> is known as the <strong>“Garden Isle”</strong> of the Hawaiian islands.
        <br> This fertile stunner is mostly covered in tropical rainforest and, as a result,
        <br> it typically attracts hikers, nature-lovers and bird-watchers (the island is home
        <br> to rare species of Hawaiian honeycreepers, such as the black-masked, 
        <br>yellow-and-olive ‘akeke‘e, which is only found in the mountains of Kauai).
        <br> <br> Putting its dramatic landscape aside (for the moment, at least),Kauai has
        <br> a lovely laidback vibe and feels a million miles from the hubbub of Honolulu. But
        <br> drama is what the island does best, as epitomised by the jaw-dropping pinnacles of
        <br> the Na Pali Coast, oft-featured in Hollywood adventure films. This coastline is 
        <br> a genuine geological wonder - its natural rock spires were created by two types of
        <br> erosion after the island was formed hundreds of thousands of years ago. </p>
